# minitt-rs

Rust implementation of Mini-TT, a simple dependently-typed lambda calculus.
It can be used as a core language for complicated dependently-typed programming
languages, or used for testing the correctness of translation algorithms.

I'm trying my best to use complete and meaningful namings.
